**Note: This repository solves a 2D heat problem with implementation of Gauss-Siedel. The algorithm for Gauss-Siedel can be found in "utility.cpp"**

Use Visual studio to view the solution and compile it on your own.

A Release build is also provided named as "solution.exe" in the folder for directly executing the programme.
